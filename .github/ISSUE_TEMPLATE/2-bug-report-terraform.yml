        Before submitting a bug report, we ask that you first search existing issues to see if someone else may have experienced the same issue. This helps to keep all relevant information in one place, including any potential workarounds.

        In the next few fields, please provide any useful information you can around what resources are affected, what you expected to happen, and what actually happened. There is also a field to optionally provide a small snippet of any relevant error or panic output.

        Note that there is a section later in the form to provide more complete Terraform configuration and logging information. These fields should instead be thought of as the place to briefly describe the bug.
